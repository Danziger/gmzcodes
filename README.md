Running It (Development)
------------------------

Take a look at `package.json`, the scripts are self-explanatory, but otherwise `npm install` and `npm start` work in `90%` of teh cases :D

The project will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/.

TODOs & Bug
-----------

### Bugs

- Adjust side paddings to be included in the header links and button.

- Hide "Hiring?" label in screenshot mode.

- Close menu when enabling focus mode.

- Hide (custom) cursor while resizing.

- Improve performance on large high-res screens. See:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Optimizing_canvas
  - https://github.com/karellodewijk/canvas-webgl
  - https://github.com/jagenjo/Canvas2DtoWebGL
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/webgl/comments/sc4024/is_webgl_fast_than_canvas_api_for_drawing_a_bunch/
  - Consider breaking down the canvas into smaller ones (tiles).
  - Consider adding other brush shapes, like any other standard drawing app (e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqUM4mEYKA)

- The canvas looks blurry on screens with decimal DPI values. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15661339/how-do-i-fix-blurry-text-in-my-html5-canvas.

<br />


### JS Paint Features

- Image upload. See https://medium.com/@agbales/how-to-make-8-bit-art-with-javascript-eea808a70ba2

- Move cursor position to a corner.

- Multiple types and sizes of brushes (square, circle).

- Consider a non-pixel-art version of the app where you can use a regular "pen" brush.

- Custom colors.

- Undo/redo.

- Resize and keep canvas.

- Multitouch on mobile.

- Block trajectory in X/Y or diagonal axis.

- Fill tool.

<br />


### Other Features

- Add an option to send drawings to me (to Supabase, maybe).

- Show artist picture.

- Add "Hiring?" and attribution inside the menu too.

- Toggle cursor type (native (default + pen), custom, both). Consider using 2 settings, one for regular interaction and the other one for drawing.

- Consider removing vibration toggle (it can be done from the phone).

<br />


### Tech Debt

- Update dependencies.

- Use a `<template>` for `.content__warningHeader`.

- Review aria tags and code organization.

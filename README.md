Running It (Development)
------------------------

Take a look at `package.json`, the scripts are self-explanatory, but otherwise `npm install` and `npm start` work in `90%` of teh cases :D

Ideas & TODOs
-------------

- Add an expandable circular button where the clear button is that expands and shows some other canvas-related options such as clear, download and toggle audio.

- Add multiple themes/messages for supported causes or special dates: Halloween, Christmas, Easter, May 4th, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Programmer...

- Screenshot mode with multiple sizes.

- Multitouch on mobile.

- Undo/redo.

- Resize and keep canvas.

- Block trajectory in X/Y or diagonal axis.

- Add a placeholder for the page logo in case it doesn't load.

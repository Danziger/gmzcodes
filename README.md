Running It (Development)

Ongoing Work (TODOs)
--------------------

### Accessibility

- User proper HTML elements (button), and add hover/focus styles to them and to link at the top.
- Breakpoints for main text size.
- Better layout (text should be centered but aligned to left).
- Unsupported browsers warning.
- Offline warning and confirmation when trying to open a link.
- Dynamically resized bottom menu that can accommodate more actions.
- Add a better mobile mode that can lock/unlock the scroll if needed.


### Keyboard Support

- Clear canvas with Esc key.
- Download drawing with Enter key.
- Select colors with numeric keys.
- Make this fully accessible with arrows, space and supr keys.


### Easter Eggs

- Custom color selector (console).
- Random color palette on load: cyberpunk, halloween, christmas
- Night mode.


### Canvas

- Download/share your creation.
- Change cursor/brush size/shape.
- Multitouch on mobile.
- Undo (canvas snapshots).
- Color sorting by usage.
- Custom colors / more colors.
- Resize and keep image.
- Block trajectory in X/Y or diagonal axis.


### Tech

- Add a basic Webpack setup to minify the code.
- Create a GMZPaint class for all the drawing logic.
- Deploy from `dist` directory. See https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/deploying-your-js-app-to-github-pages-the-easy-way-or-not-1ef8c48424b7.
- Screenshot mode.

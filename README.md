Ongoing Work (TODOs)
--------------------

### Bugs:

* Cursor not always hidden when mouse goes out of the window (probably re-shown from requestAnimationFrame).

### Accessibility

* User proper HTML elements (button), and add hover/focus styles to them and to link at the top.
* Offline warning.


### Design/responsiveness

* Prevent mouse pointer mode while drawing.
* Better layout (text should be centered but aligned to left).
* Do not use a fixed vertical position in small screens.
- Dynamically resized bottom menu that can accommodate more actions.
- Add a better mobile mode that can lock/unlock the scroll if needed.


### Keyboard/Mobile Support

* Increase brush size with +/-.
* Download drawing with Enter key.
* Shake to clear.
- Multitouch on mobile.
- Make this fully accessible with arrows, Space, Shift keys and... Sound?


### Easter Eggs

* Night mode.
* Random color palette on load: cyberpunk, halloween, christmas.
* Fade text away as you draw.
- Custom color selector (console).


### Canvas

- Download/share your creation.
- Change cursor/brush size/shape.
- Undo (canvas snapshots).
- Color sorting by usage.
- Custom colors / more colors.
- Resize and keep image.
- Block trajectory in X/Y or diagonal axis.


### Tech

* Add a basic Webpack setup to minify the code and add hashes to the bundles so that the Service Worker always returns the latest versions.
* Create a class for all the drawing logic.
* Deploy from `dist` directory. See https://medium.com/linagora-engineering/deploying-your-js-app-to-github-pages-the-easy-way-or-not-1ef8c48424b7.
* Screenshot mode.
* Add sounds: https://www.zapsplat.com/music/internal-organ-or-bloody-guts-drop-on-ground-squelch-splat/, https://www.zapsplat.com/music/wet-mop-splat-on-tiled-floor-2/, https://www.zapsplat.com/music/wet-mop-splat-on-tiled-floor-4/, https://www.zapsplat.com/music/wet-mop-splat-on-tiled-floor-1/, https://www.zapsplat.com/music/flesh-splat-squirt-drops-gore-blood-horror/, https://www.zapsplat.com/license-type/standard-license/
